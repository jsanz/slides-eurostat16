Talks template
==================

This is a minimal template to create slides using [reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/) and markdown editing. Just download the repo
and start writing at the `talk.md` file.


You can download the full [reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/) distribution for offline usage, even
some fonts will be missed. Also you can tweak the index.html for custom options on the slides, see the
reveal.js documentation.

Have a nice day<br/>
